## Inspiration

Colors are fun but when you are developing and creating themes, knowing the correct color combinations can be challenging. However, knowing the RGB Values is just as challenging because the 3 color values are based on a value from 0 - 225. Depending on the increased values of Red, Green, and/or Blue, you could create any color on the spectrum. How you get there is the real challenge. I figured, not only will the game be fun, but also a learning experience in order for the give people a sense of which RGB they like and could use in their web development.

## What it does

The game has 3 difficulties, the main point is to use your knowledge of hexadecimal/RGB and figure out which color is being displayed.

## How we built it

The game is made using javascript and css. The rgb value is randomly generated and there are several options to choose from. 

## Challenge we ran into

Ensuring that the RGB Value was purely random and unique was the biggest challenge and recreating difficulties to match the game functionality.
