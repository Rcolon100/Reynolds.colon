## Inspiration

In today's soceity, there are so many distractions. Sometimes, you want to spend a few hours simply studying or getting things done. Some people just do not have the attention span.

In 2000, Microsoft conducted a study measuring how long people can focus on one thing for a specific amount of time. The results showed the average personâ€™s attention span was 12 seconds. In 2015, it dropped to 8 seconds. A recent study from the Technical University of Denmark suggests our collective global attention span is narrowing because of the abundance of information presented to us. 

## What it does

My Google Chrome extension allows you to put an amount of time that you want to focus. It then blocks access to all interruptive sites such as YouTube, Twitch, Reddit, and etc. This allows you to focus on writing papers, studying, writing code, and anything productive.

## How I built it

I built the Chrome Extension with my expertise in Web Development and Javascript by using the core idea of DOM Manipulation.

## Challenge we ran into

Honestly, the biggest challenge was simply getting the Chrome Extension to allow a user to input a time slot and ensuring that productive sites were not blocked.
