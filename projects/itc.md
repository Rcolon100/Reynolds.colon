## Inspiration

I have friends that like camping and I loved to use Yelp to find locations. I wanted to create a mock website that would work as a AirBnB/Yelp style for camping grounds so campers can rate and share their favorite campsites.

## What it does

The application is similar to AirBnB and Yelp in that users can find create secure accounts, create campgrounds and rate them among fellow campers.

## How we built it

The application is a Full Stack javascript progressive web app using Javascript, Node, MongoDB, and using Cloud Storage.

## Challenge we ran into

The biggest challenge is ensuring Cloud Storage would continue to hold the photo thumbnails and user data is completely secure by Unit Testing.
