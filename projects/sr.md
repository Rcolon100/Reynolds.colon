## Inspiration

Art and music are great coping mechanisms when it comes to stress or sometimes people are heavily distracted. For people with different levels of ADHD there are fidgets. I thought there could be a calming way to distract people using a mindless tapping game using the keyboard to generate calming sounds and music

## What it does

Each key on your keyboard is a unique relaxing sound, press a key hear a music sound and watch as colorful gradient circles disappear among the abyss

## How I built it

I utilized Javascript's built in canvas, to create a solid black abyss as well as jquery and css to create the visuals and commands for colorful changing circles.

## Challenge we ran into

The main challenge was learning how to develop using canvas and using css to transform the circles without creating redundancy per key.
